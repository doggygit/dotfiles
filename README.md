My Fish-Shell - Config
======================

Install (Ubuntu 14.04)
-------
Put the following commands to your bash (the install.sh will not set fish as default shell if you currently use zsh):

```
sudo apt-get install fish
git clone https://github.com/CrusaderW/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles && ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```
